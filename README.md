## IP Addresses

used to identify and locate devices on a network.

* types
    1. IPV4
        inet `192.168.57.139` . dotted decimal format -> 32bit
    2. IPV6
        inetv6 `fe90::20c:29ff:fe0a:4205` . hexadecimal format -> 123 bit


        - IPv4 and IPv6 are versions of the Internet Protocol that provide unique addresses to devices on a network
        - transition from IPv4 to IPv6 is necessary due to the depletion of available IPv4 addresses
        - IPv6 provide better security, auto-configuration etc
