## IP Addresses

used to identify and locate devices on a network. (layer 3)

* types
    1. IPV4
        inet `192.168.57.139` . dotted decimal format -> 32bit -> can range from 0 to 255
    2. IPV6
        inetv6 `fe90::20c:29ff:fe0a:4205` . hexadecimal format -> 123 bit


        - IPv4 and IPv6 are versions of the Internet Protocol that provide unique addresses to devices on a network
        - transition from IPv4 to IPv6 is necessary due to the depletion of available IPv4 addresses
        - IPv6 provide better security, auto-configuration etc

* NAT Network address translation

1. Private IP Address (ex: in home 
, a lot of devices are connected to the internet and all devices are assigned Ip addresses)
    - class A   `10.0.0.0` -> used by companies bcz small amount of network but large amount of hosts
    - class B   `172.16.0.0` to `172.31.0.0`
    - class c   `192.168.0.0` to `192.1680255.255` -> used at home
    - Loopback  `127.0.0.0` to `127.0.0.7`

2. Public Ip Address (The one's that are brought from ISP, internet service provider)
